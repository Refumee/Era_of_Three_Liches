Quick is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower moving units such as trolls or heavy infantry. Units with the quick trait often have greatly increased mobility in rough terrain, which can be important to consider when deploying your forces. Also, quick units arenâ€™t quite as tough as units without this trait and are subsequently less good at holding contested positions."
