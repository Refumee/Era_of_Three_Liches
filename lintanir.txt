Lintair, Heart of the Forest:
Uradredia:
The trees bloosom, the day is fair, oh such delight! Parandra, join me and let us sing!
Prandra:
In forgotten times
on the endless plain
Ardel saw the grass
and made it fair
from the mountain brook
in the lands of Er
she took a flower
plain as day
it grew in fall
and touched the airs
and it touched forever
the heart of Elves
whee they call me the budget tolkien
such cheap writing, such inconsistent sylable counts, quick someone give me a reward
anyway, there's not muhc to tell, it's the same story with the saurians, introduce the characters, show the journey screen with a narration of it, cut back to map and do battle
for every tree that Arkhaaz touches, it transforms into an ice woose
gl elves, you'll need it
since the trees are living beings, and these big trees are more alive than most, it's only approapriate they get to transfrom into undead wooses that have a cold  attack instead of an impact one 
it also incetivises both parties to fight and try to ocntrol mid, nobody is gonna stand on the defence, the undead want free good recruits, the elves want to stop them from doing so
