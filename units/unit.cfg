        description= _"Undead are not really a single race of creatures, although often treated as such. Most ordinary creatures can, by a sufficiently skilled necromancer, be reanimated into constructs of varying character — resurrection of the physical form often results in a minion that obeys its master without question, while manifestation of a soul usually produces a servant with at least a modicum of thought. A great mystery of necromancy is how these constructs are sustained and controlled without continuous effort from the necromancer. Most dark magi do not provide constant attention or maintenance to their creations, instead allowing them a small degree of independence to function autonomously in line with the provided commands. However, when left unchecked, some undead gain enough sovereignty to break free from and even turn on their masters. Accordingly, while even lesser undead require periodic maintenance, this is especially true for more powerful undead, particularly greater spirits or death knights, who possess a high degree of inherent will. In these cases, necromancy becomes a battle of resolve between mage and minion. The necromancer must maintain a delicate balance between control over their servants and allotting them free will — the source of their individual powers.

Necromancy is almost solely limited to humans. Even the legends of magically apt races like elves and merfolk tell of very few of their kind who have ever delved in the dark arts. It is surmised that necromantic magic requires great adaptability and a flexible mind, extremes of which are most commonly found in humans. The ultimate goal of most necromancers is to turn the same art of preserving and imbuing life upon themselves, to alter themselves at whatever cost, to ultimately escape death by preserving their own mind and spirit.
