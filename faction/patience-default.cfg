"+_"The <bold>text='Undead'</bold> are a faction of <ref>text='undead' dst='..race_undead'</ref> creatures and <ref>text='human' dst='..race_human'</ref> practitioners of dark arts that usually accompany them. Often, these “Dark Adepts” are the units that do the most damage for the faction, but they have a major vulnerability — their practicing of this forbidden, evil magic has consumed all their energy and so they have no melee attack at all. The Undead are a very aggressive faction and the most powerful <ref>text='Default Era' dst='..era_era_default'</ref> faction at nighttime."
